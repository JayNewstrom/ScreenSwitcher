Screen Switcher
=========

Screen Switcher is a library that makes transitioning between screens and managing the backstack trivial. 

Usage
------------

Use the `ScreenSwitcher` to perform operations such as `#push(Screen)`, `#pop(numberOfScreensToPop)`.

Bootstrap
------------

There is a fair amount of work to get ScreenSwitcher integrated in your app. 
Please see the [bootstrapping guide][bootstrap] or clone the sample for a full example.

Setup
------------
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.jaynewstrom:screen-switcher:0.9.0'
}
```
